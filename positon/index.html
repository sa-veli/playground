      <h2>Header one</h2>

      <p class="general-paragraph">
        I start with basics.
        <code>position: absolute;</code>
        is a simple thing. Use
        <code>top: [value];</code>
        or other side's name to change where your element position itself.
        If value is zero than it will placed in top left corner of the page. Use
        <code>position: relative;</code>
        on ancestor element to positon relative to it. See example below.
      </p>

      <div class="ancestor">
        This is an ancestor element.
        <div class="absolute">Absolute position relative to an ancestor element.</div>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section id="two">
      <h2>Header two</h2>

      <p class="general-paragraph">
        <code>position: relative;</code>
        Element positioned according to normal flow of the document and then offset
        <span>relative to itself</span>
        based on values of
        <code>top bottom</code>
        and so on.
      </p>
      <p class="general-paragraph">
        Divs are block-level elements that's why boxes below are not placed on the same line.
      </p>

      <div class="relative--shadow-example">
        <p>
          This is where box would have been placed if it didn't had <code>position:&nbsp;relative;</code>
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="relative">
        <p>
          This box has positon relative. Its css declarations include:
          <code>
            left:&nbsp;250px;
          </code>
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section id="three">
      <h2>Header three</h2>

      <p class="general-paragraph">
        <code>positon: fixed;</code>
        it offsets relative to viewport and stays on screen even when we scroll. Box stuck to the right side of the page
        has this declaration.
      </p>

      <div class="fixed">This box has position: fixed. See third section to understand what is going on with it.</div>
    </section>

    <section id="four">
      <h2>Header four</h2>

      <p class="general-paragraph">
        <code>position: sticky;</code>
        This rule declaration made element stick to on of the sides of viewport. And we can make it offset. If I write
        <code>bottom: 0;</code>
        it will stay on bottom.
        Headers and navigation menu on this page use this declaration. Notice how headers replace each other but
        navigation menu stays on top. This happens because nav menu is part of <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> and headers are
        part of their respective sections.
